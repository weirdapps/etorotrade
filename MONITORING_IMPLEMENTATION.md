# Monitoring & Observability Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the approach to implementing enhanced monitoring and observability for the etorotrade application. The implementation will build on the existing monitoring capabilities while adding new features for better production readiness.

## Current Status

The codebase already has strong monitoring foundations:
- Comprehensive metrics collection 
- Health checks framework
- Circuit breaker monitoring
- Request tracking
- Alert management
- Monitoring dashboard

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Structured Logging Enhancement

- **Format**: Implement JSON structured logging for better aggregation
- **Context**: Ensure consistent context information in all log messages
- **Correlation**: Add request IDs to logs for traceability
- **Sanitization**: Ensure sensitive data is properly scrubbed
- **Performance**: Optimize logging to minimize performance impact

### 2. REST Health Check Endpoints

- **Implementation**: Create HTTP API for health check endpoints
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/health`: Overall system health status
  - `/health/live`: Liveness check
  - `/health/ready`: Readiness check
  - `/health/metrics`: Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint
  - `/health/components`: Detailed component health status
- **Security**: Add basic authentication for sensitive endpoint access
- **Documentation**: Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- **Implementation**: Create standalone HTTP server that can run alongside main application

### 3. Metrics Collection Enhancement

- **Performance Metrics**: Add more granular performance tracking
- **Business Metrics**: Track domain-specific metrics:
  - Trade execution metrics
  - Data processing pipeline metrics
  - Resource utilization metrics
- **Storage**: Implement configurable metrics retention
- **Export**: Add Prometheus & StatsD format compatibility
- **Visualization**: Enhance dashboard with additional charts
- **Alerting**: Set up threshold-based alerting

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will focus on a modular approach:

1. Structured logging will be implemented first
2. Health check endpoints will be added
3. Metrics collection enhancements will be implemented last

Each component will be implemented with backward compatibility in mind to ensure existing functionality isn't disrupted.

## Timeline

- Structured logging: 1 day
- Health check endpoints: 1-2 days
- Metrics collection enhancements: 1-2 days

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All logs are output in structured format with consistent context
2. Health check endpoints are accessible and return appropriate responses
3. Additional metrics are collected and properly exported
4. Dashboard visualizes the enhanced metrics
5. Basic alerting is in place for key metrics
