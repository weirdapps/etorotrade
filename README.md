## üí≤ Three-Tier Trading System

etorotrade uses a sophisticated **three-tier trading system** that classifies stocks by market cap and applies appropriate risk-adjusted criteria. This approach recognizes that large-cap blue chips require different analysis than small-cap speculative plays.

### üèóÔ∏è Market Cap Tier Classification

**VALUE Tier (‚â•$100B)**: Large-cap quality companies
- **Philosophy**: Conservative approach for established blue chips
- **Examples**: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon

**GROWTH Tier ($5B-$100B)**: Mid-cap growth companies  
- **Philosophy**: Balanced risk/reward for established growers
- **Examples**: Most established companies with growth potential

**BETS Tier (<$5B)**: Small-cap speculative positions
- **Philosophy**: Higher bar for speculative investments
- **Examples**: Small-cap growth stocks, emerging companies

**M Column**: Every output shows tier classification (V/G/B) for instant risk assessment

### üü¢ BUY Recommendations (Tier-Specific)

**VALUE Tier BUY** (‚â•$100B market cap):
- **Conservative Upside**: 15%+ potential upside (reasonable for large-caps)
- **Analyst Consensus**: 70%+ buy ratings (strong support needed)  
- **Expected Return**: ‚â•10% (balanced threshold for stability)
- **Risk Management**: Higher position size tolerance due to stability

**GROWTH Tier BUY** ($5B-$100B market cap):
- **Standard Upside**: 20%+ potential upside
- **Analyst Consensus**: 75%+ buy ratings
- **Expected Return**: ‚â•15% (standard requirement)
- **Risk Management**: Balanced position sizing and thresholds

**BETS Tier BUY** (<$5B market cap):
- **Aggressive Upside**: 25%+ potential upside (high returns for risk)
- **Strong Consensus**: 80%+ buy ratings (conviction required)
- **High Return**: ‚â•20% expected return (compensation for risk)
- **Risk Management**: Smaller positions, stricter fundamentals

**Common BUY Requirements** (All Tiers):
- **Reasonable Volatility**: Beta between 0.25 and 3.0
- **Attractive Valuation**: Forward P/E 0.5-65.0, Trailing P/E required
- **Quality Factors**: PEG < 2.5, Low short interest (if available)
- **Sufficient Coverage**: ‚â•5 analyst ratings and ‚â•5 price targets

### üî¥ SELL Signals (Tier-Specific)

**VALUE Tier SELL** (‚â•$100B market cap):
- **Limited Upside**: <5% upside potential
- **Weak Support**: <50% buy ratings
- **Poor Returns**: <5% expected return

**GROWTH Tier SELL** ($5B-$100B market cap):
- **Limited Upside**: <8% upside potential  
- **Weak Support**: <60% buy ratings
- **Poor Returns**: <8% expected return

**BETS Tier SELL** (<$5B market cap):
- **Limited Upside**: <12% upside potential
- **Weak Support**: <70% buy ratings
- **Poor Returns**: <10% expected return

**Common SELL Triggers** (All Tiers):
- **Overvaluation**: Forward P/E >65.0, PEG >3.0, or excessive PE expansion
- **Poor Fundamentals**: Earnings growth <-15%, Price performance <-35%
- **High Risk**: Short interest >3%, Beta >3.0, Expected return <2.5%

### ‚ö™ HOLD & üü° INCONCLUSIVE
- **HOLD**: Passes confidence thresholds but doesn't meet tier-specific BUY/SELL criteria
- **INCONCLUSIVE**: Insufficient analyst coverage (<5 targets or ratings)

## üìä Enhanced Data Columns

etorotrade now includes additional fundamental analysis columns for more comprehensive stock evaluation:

### New Data Columns
- **EG (Earnings Growth)**: Year-over-year earnings growth percentage from quarterly data
- **PP (Price Performance)**: 3-month price performance showing recent momentum (shows `--` when data unavailable)
- **Enhanced Position Sizing**: Updated to consider high conviction criteria

### Data Availability Notes
- **PP Column**: Shows `--` when price performance data is unavailable from Yahoo Finance API
- **Common for**: ETFs, crypto, international stocks, and smaller stocks
- **This is expected behavior** - the system correctly shows `--` instead of misleading information

### High Conviction Position Sizing
The system now identifies high conviction opportunities using multiple criteria:
- **High Conviction Criteria**: EG >15% AND PP >0% AND EXRET >20%
- **Position Range**: 0.5% to 10% of portfolio ($2,250 to $45,000)
- **Smart Scaling**: Higher conviction = larger position sizes

### üéØ Dual-Listed Stock Handling (New 2025-01-28)

etorotrade now features **intelligent dual-listed stock normalization** that handles stocks trading on multiple exchanges, ensuring consistent analysis and preventing duplicate portfolio positions.

### Key Features
- **Automatic Normalization**: US tickers (ADRs, cross-listings) are automatically converted to their original exchange tickers
- **Portfolio Deduplication**: Prevents suggesting stocks you already own under different ticker symbols  
- **Geographic Risk Assessment**: Applies correct geographic multipliers based on the original exchange
- **Consistent Display**: All outputs use the canonical ticker for clarity

### Supported Dual-Listed Stocks
The system handles major dual-listings including:

**European Stocks with US ADRs:**
- NVO ‚Üí NOVO-B.CO (Novo Nordisk)
- SNY ‚Üí SAN.PA (Sanofi)  
- ASML ‚Üí ASML.NV (ASML Netherlands)
- SHEL ‚Üí SHEL.L (Shell London)

**Asian Stocks with US ADRs:**
- JD ‚Üí 9618.HK (JD.com)
- BABA ‚Üí 9988.HK (Alibaba)
- TCEHY ‚Üí 0700.HK (Tencent)

**Share Class Normalization:**
- GOOGL ‚Üí GOOG (Google Class C as main ticker)

### Portfolio Impact
If you own **NVO** (Novo Nordisk ADR), the system will:
1. Display it as **NOVO-B.CO** in all outputs
2. Apply **European (0.75x)** geographic risk multiplier
3. **Prevent** suggesting NOVO-B.CO as a buy opportunity
4. Use the **same analysis** whether you input NVO or NOVO-B.CO

## üéØ Robust Target Price Mechanism

etorotrade features a sophisticated **quality-validated target price system** that goes beyond simple analyst medians to provide more reliable upside calculations:

#### Quality Assessment System
Every stock's analyst price targets are automatically graded on a **5-tier quality scale**:

- **Grade A (85-100)**: Excellent consensus with tight target ranges
- **Grade B (70-84)**: Good quality with minor disagreements
- **Grade C (55-69)**: Moderate quality with some outliers
- **Grade D (40-54)**: Poor quality requiring manual review
- **Grade F (<40)**: Excluded due to unreliable data

#### Robustness Scoring Factors
The system evaluates price target quality using multiple criteria:

- **Spread Analysis**: Penalizes excessive target ranges (>50% concerning, >75% severe)
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies extreme predictions that skew averages
- **Consensus Validation**: Rewards tight agreement between mean and median
- **Coverage Assessment**: Considers analyst count and expertise level
- **Price Reasonableness**: Flags targets >300% from current price

#### Trading Decision Impact
- **Grades A-C**: Uses quality-validated median target with confidence indicators
- **Grade D**: Still participates in trading but flagged for manual review
- **Grade F**: Excluded from buy/sell recommendations entirely
- **Fallback Protection**: Reverts to simple median if robust calculation fails

The robust mechanism **prioritizes data quality over raw numbers**, ensuring trading decisions are based on reliable analyst consensus rather than potentially misleading outliers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Trading Criteria
All trading criteria can be customized by editing a single file: `yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py`

This centralized configuration ensures consistency across:
- ACT column values (B/S/H/I)
- M column tier classification (V/G/B)
- Color coding (green/red/yellow highlighting)
- Buy/Sell/Hold opportunity filtering
- All recommendation outputs

Example tier customization:
```python
# In yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py
class TradingCriteria:
    # Adjust market cap tier boundaries
    VALUE_TIER_MIN_CAP = 50_000_000_000   # $50B threshold (was $100B)
    GROWTH_TIER_MIN_CAP = 2_000_000_000   # $2B threshold (was $5B)
    
    # Customize VALUE tier BUY criteria (example: more conservative)
    VALUE_BUY_MIN_UPSIDE = 10.0           # Lower upside needed (current: 15%)
    VALUE_BUY_MIN_BUY_PERCENTAGE = 65.0   # Lower consensus (current: 70%)
    
    # Customize BETS tier BUY criteria (example: more aggressive)
    BETS_BUY_MIN_UPSIDE = 30.0            # Higher upside required (current: 25%)
    BETS_BUY_MIN_BUY_PERCENTAGE = 85.0    # Higher consensus (current: 80%)
```

### üí∞ Intelligent Position Sizing (Updated 2025-01-27)

etorotrade features a sophisticated position sizing system that calculates optimal trade sizes based on portfolio allocation, risk management, and expected returns with tier-based and geographic adjustments.

#### Position Sizing Strategy
- **Portfolio Value**: $450,000 (configurable in `yahoofinance/core/config.py`)
- **Base Position**: 0.5% of portfolio = $2,250 for standard opportunities  
- **Position Limits**: $1,000 minimum, $40,000 maximum (8.9% max allocation)
- **Extended EXRET Range**: Multipliers from 0.5x to 5.0x for better differentiation

#### Enhanced Sizing Logic
1. **EXRET-Based Scaling**: Extended multiplier range for better opportunity differentiation
   - EXRET ‚â• 40%: Exceptional opportunity (5.0x multiplier)
   - EXRET ‚â• 30%: High opportunity (4.0x multiplier)
   - EXRET ‚â• 25%: Good opportunity (3.0x multiplier)
   - EXRET ‚â• 20%: Standard opportunity (2.0x multiplier)
   - EXRET ‚â• 15%: Lower opportunity (1.5x multiplier)
   - EXRET ‚â• 10%: Base position (1.0x multiplier)
   - EXRET < 10%: Conservative (0.5x multiplier)

2. **Tier-Based Market Cap Scaling**: Rewards stability and appropriate risk
   - **VALUE tier** (‚â•$100B): 2.5x multiplier (enhanced for stability)
   - **GROWTH tier** ($5B-$100B): 1.5x multiplier (standard allocation)
   - **BETS tier** (<$5B): 0.5x multiplier (conservative small-cap sizing)

3. **Geographic Risk Management**: Concentration risk mitigation (Updated 2025-01-28)
   - **Hong Kong** (.HK): 0.5x multiplier (enhanced reduction for overexposure)
   - **Europe** (.L, .PA, .DE, etc.): 0.75x multiplier (moderate reduction)
   - **All other markets**: 1.0x multiplier (no adjustment)

#### Display Format
Position sizes are shown in the SIZE column with intuitive formatting:
- $2,000 ‚Üí "2k"
- $7,500 ‚Üí "7.5k" 
- $15,000 ‚Üí "15k"

#### Exclusions
- ETFs and commodities: No position sizing (SIZE shows "--")
- Stocks under $500M market cap: Excluded for liquidity concerns
- Missing data: No position size without EXRET or market cap
