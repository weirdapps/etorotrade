## üí≤ Trading Criteria

etorotrade uses a sophisticated classification system based on financial metrics, analyst consensus, and technical indicators. **All trading criteria are centralized in a single configuration file** for consistency across all analysis types.

### üü¢ BUY Recommendations
A stock must meet ALL of these criteria:
- **Strong Upside**: 20%+ potential upside
- **Analyst Consensus**: 85%+ buy ratings
- **Reasonable Volatility**: Beta between 0.25 and 2.5
- **Attractive Valuation**: 
  - Improving earnings outlook (Forward P/E < Trailing P/E OR Trailing P/E ‚â§ 0)
  - Reasonable Forward P/E (0.5 < PEF ‚â§ 45.0)
  - Good growth-adjusted value (PEG < 2.5)
- **Limited Risk Factors**: 
  - Low short interest (‚â§ 1.5%)
  - Strong expected return (‚â• 15.0)

### üî¥ SELL Signals
A stock triggers a SELL if ANY of these warning signs appear:
- **Limited Upside**: Less than 5% upside potential
- **Weak Analyst Support**: Less than 65% buy ratings
- **Deteriorating Earnings**: Forward P/E > Trailing P/E (worsening outlook)
- **Overvaluation**: Forward P/E > 50.0 or PEG > 3.0
- **High Risk Factors**: Short interest > 2% or Beta > 3.0
- **Poor Expected Return**: EXRET < 5.0

### ‚ö™ HOLD Recommendations
- Passes confidence thresholds but doesn't meet full BUY or SELL criteria
- May have mixed signals or be fairly valued at current price

### üü° INCONCLUSIVE Classification
- Insufficient analyst coverage (< 5 price targets or < 5 analyst ratings)
- Not enough data for confident decision-making

### üéØ Robust Target Price Mechanism

etorotrade features a sophisticated **quality-validated target price system** that goes beyond simple analyst medians to provide more reliable upside calculations:

#### Quality Assessment System
Every stock's analyst price targets are automatically graded on a **5-tier quality scale**:

- **Grade A (85-100)**: Excellent consensus with tight target ranges
- **Grade B (70-84)**: Good quality with minor disagreements
- **Grade C (55-69)**: Moderate quality with some outliers
- **Grade D (40-54)**: Poor quality requiring manual review
- **Grade F (<40)**: Excluded due to unreliable data

#### Robustness Scoring Factors
The system evaluates price target quality using multiple criteria:

- **Spread Analysis**: Penalizes excessive target ranges (>50% concerning, >75% severe)
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies extreme predictions that skew averages
- **Consensus Validation**: Rewards tight agreement between mean and median
- **Coverage Assessment**: Considers analyst count and expertise level
- **Price Reasonableness**: Flags targets >300% from current price

#### Trading Decision Impact
- **Grades A-C**: Uses quality-validated median target with confidence indicators
- **Grade D**: Still participates in trading but flagged for manual review
- **Grade F**: Excluded from buy/sell recommendations entirely
- **Fallback Protection**: Reverts to simple median if robust calculation fails

The robust mechanism **prioritizes data quality over raw numbers**, ensuring trading decisions are based on reliable analyst consensus rather than potentially misleading outliers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Trading Criteria
All trading criteria can be customized by editing a single file: `yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py`

This centralized configuration ensures consistency across:
- ACT column values (B/S/H/I)
- Color coding (green/red/yellow highlighting)
- Buy/Sell/Hold opportunity filtering
- All recommendation outputs

Example customization:
```python
# In yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py
class TradingCriteria:
    # Make BUY criteria more aggressive
    BUY_MIN_UPSIDE = 25.0              # Require 25% upside (was 20%)
    BUY_MIN_BUY_PERCENTAGE = 90.0      # Require 90% buy rating (was 85%)
    
    # Make SELL criteria more conservative  
    SELL_MAX_UPSIDE = 3.0              # Sell if upside < 3% (was 5%)
```

### üí∞ Position Size Calculation
The system automatically calculates optimal position sizes based on market cap and expected return:
- Formula: `position_size = market_cap * EXRET / 5,000,000,000`
- Uses default EXRET values (10-15%) when actual EXRET is unavailable
- Result is rounded up to the nearest thousand with minimum size of $1,000

## üìÅ Input Files

Create or edit these CSV files in the `yahoofinance/input/` directory:
