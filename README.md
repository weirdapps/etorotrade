## üí≤ Trading Criteria

etorotrade uses a sophisticated classification system based on financial metrics, analyst consensus, and technical indicators:

### üü¢ BUY Recommendations
A stock must meet ALL of these criteria:
- **Strong Upside**: 20%+ potential upside
- **Analyst Consensus**: 85%+ buy ratings
- **Reasonable Volatility**: Beta between 0.25 and 2.5
- **Attractive Valuation**: 
  - Improving earnings outlook (Forward P/E - Trailing P/E < 0.5)
  - Reasonable Forward P/E (0.5 < PEF ‚â§ 45.0)
  - Good growth-adjusted value (PEG < 2.5)
- **Limited Risk Factors**: 
  - Low short interest (‚â§ 1.5%)
  - Strong expected return (‚â• 15.0)

### üî¥ SELL Signals
A stock triggers a SELL if ANY of these warning signs appear:
- **Limited Upside**: Less than 5% upside potential
- **Weak Analyst Support**: Less than 65% buy ratings
- **Deteriorating Earnings**: Forward P/E - Trailing P/E > 0.5
- **Overvaluation**: Forward P/E > 50.0 or PEG > 3.0
- **High Risk Factors**: Short interest > 2% or Beta > 3.0
- **Poor Expected Return**: EXRET < 5.0

### ‚ö™ HOLD Recommendations
- Passes confidence thresholds but doesn't meet full BUY or SELL criteria
- May have mixed signals or be fairly valued at current price

### üü° INCONCLUSIVE Classification
- Insufficient analyst coverage (< 5 price targets or < 5 analyst ratings)
- Not enough data for confident decision-making

### üí∞ Position Size Calculation
The system automatically calculates optimal position sizes based on market cap and expected return:
- Formula: `position_size = market_cap * EXRET / 5,000,000,000`
- Uses default EXRET values (10-15%) when actual EXRET is unavailable
- Result is rounded up to the nearest thousand with minimum size of $1,000

## üìÅ Input Files

```
