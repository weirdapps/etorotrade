## Trading Classification Criteria

The system uses these criteria to classify stocks into four categories:

### ðŸŸ¡ INCONCLUSIVE
- Low confidence due to insufficient analyst coverage (< 5 price targets or < 5 analyst ratings)

### ðŸ”´ SELL (Risk Management)
Triggered if ANY of these conditions are met:
- Less than 5% upside potential
- Less than 65% buy ratings from analysts
- Forward P/E (PEF) > Trailing P/E (PET) - deteriorating earnings outlook
- Forward P/E (PEF) > 50.0 (extremely high valuation)
- PEG ratio > 3.0 (overvalued relative to growth)
- Short Interest (SI) > 2% (high short interest)
- Beta > 3.0 (excessive volatility)
- Expected Return (EXRET) < 5.0 (insufficient potential return)

### ðŸŸ¢ BUY (Growth Opportunity)
ALL of these conditions must be met:
- 20% or more upside potential
- 85% or more buy ratings from analysts
- Beta data available: 0.25 < Beta â‰¤ 2.5
- PE Forward (PEF) and PE Trailing (PET) data available
- Improving earnings outlook (PEF < PET) OR Negative trailing P/E
- Positive earnings projection (0.5 < PEF â‰¤ 45.0)
- Reasonable valuation relative to growth (PEG < 2.5) - if PEG data available
- Acceptable short interest (SI â‰¤ 1.5%) - if SI data available
- Strong expected return (EXRET â‰¥ 15.0)

### âšª HOLD
- Stocks that pass confidence threshold
- Don't meet SELL criteria
- Don't meet BUY criteria

## Backtesting Framework

The backtesting framework allows you to:

1. Test your trading criteria against historical data
2. Optimize criteria parameters to find the best performing combination
3. Generate performance reports comparing to benchmark indices
4. Perform what-if analysis with different market conditions
5. Use market cap-based position weighting (1% to 10% per position) for realistic portfolio allocation
6. Analyze detailed portfolio synthesis tables with complete metrics for each position

For detailed instructions on using the backtesting framework, see [scripts/BACKTEST_README.md](scripts/BACKTEST_README.md).

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Run a 2-year backtest on your portfolio
python scripts/optimize_criteria.py --mode backtest --period 2y --source portfolio

# Optimize sell criteria parameters for maximum Sharpe ratio
python scripts/optimize_criteria.py --mode optimize --param-file scripts/sample_parameters.json

# Test specific tickers with weekly rebalancing
python scripts/optimize_criteria.py --mode backtest --tickers AAPL,MSFT,GOOGL,AMZN --rebalance weekly
```
