## üí≤ Trading Criteria

etorotrade uses a sophisticated classification system based on financial metrics, analyst consensus, and technical indicators. **All trading criteria are centralized in a single configuration file** for consistency across all analysis types.

### üü¢ BUY Recommendations
A stock must meet ALL of these criteria:
- **Strong Upside**: 20%+ potential upside
- **Analyst Consensus**: 75%+ buy ratings
- **Reasonable Volatility**: Beta between 0.25 and 2.5
- **Attractive Valuation**: 
  - Forward P/E between 0.5 and 65.0
  - Trailing P/E between 0.5 and 80.0 (required for BUY)
  - Good growth-adjusted value (PEG < 2.5, if available)
- **Strong Fundamentals**:
  - Earnings growth ‚â• -10% (if available)
  - 3-month price performance ‚â• -10% (if available)
- **Limited Risk Factors**: 
  - Low short interest (‚â§ 2.0%, if available)
  - Strong expected return (‚â• 15.0%)
- **Sufficient Coverage**: ‚â• 5 analyst ratings and ‚â• 5 price targets

### üî¥ SELL Signals
A stock triggers a SELL if ANY of these warning signs appear:
- **Limited Upside**: Less than 5% upside potential
- **Weak Analyst Support**: Less than 65% buy ratings
- **Overvaluation**: Forward P/E > 65.0 or PEG > 3.0 (if available)
- **Poor Valuation**: Forward P/E < 0.5 or P/E expanding excessively (PEF - PET > 10)
- **Poor Fundamentals**:
  - Earnings growth < -15% (if available)
  - 3-month price performance < -25% (if available)
- **High Risk Factors**: Short interest > 3.0% (if available) or Beta > 3.0
- **Poor Expected Return**: EXRET < 2.5%

### ‚ö™ HOLD Recommendations
- Passes confidence thresholds but doesn't meet full BUY or SELL criteria
- May have mixed signals or be fairly valued at current price

### üü° INCONCLUSIVE Classification
- Insufficient analyst coverage (< 5 price targets or < 5 analyst ratings)
- Not enough data for confident decision-making

## üìä Enhanced Data Columns

etorotrade now includes additional fundamental analysis columns for more comprehensive stock evaluation:

### New Data Columns
- **EG (Earnings Growth)**: Year-over-year earnings growth percentage from quarterly data
- **PP (Price Performance)**: 3-month price performance showing recent momentum (shows `--` when data unavailable)
- **Enhanced Position Sizing**: Updated to consider high conviction criteria

### Data Availability Notes
- **PP Column**: Shows `--` when price performance data is unavailable from Yahoo Finance API
- **Common for**: ETFs, crypto, international stocks, and smaller stocks
- **This is expected behavior** - the system correctly shows `--` instead of misleading information

### High Conviction Position Sizing
The system now identifies high conviction opportunities using multiple criteria:
- **High Conviction Criteria**: EG >15% AND PP >0% AND EXRET >20%
- **Position Range**: 0.5% to 10% of portfolio ($2,250 to $45,000)
- **Smart Scaling**: Higher conviction = larger position sizes

### üéØ Robust Target Price Mechanism

etorotrade features a sophisticated **quality-validated target price system** that goes beyond simple analyst medians to provide more reliable upside calculations:

#### Quality Assessment System
Every stock's analyst price targets are automatically graded on a **5-tier quality scale**:

- **Grade A (85-100)**: Excellent consensus with tight target ranges
- **Grade B (70-84)**: Good quality with minor disagreements
- **Grade C (55-69)**: Moderate quality with some outliers
- **Grade D (40-54)**: Poor quality requiring manual review
- **Grade F (<40)**: Excluded due to unreliable data

#### Robustness Scoring Factors
The system evaluates price target quality using multiple criteria:

- **Spread Analysis**: Penalizes excessive target ranges (>50% concerning, >75% severe)
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies extreme predictions that skew averages
- **Consensus Validation**: Rewards tight agreement between mean and median
- **Coverage Assessment**: Considers analyst count and expertise level
- **Price Reasonableness**: Flags targets >300% from current price

#### Trading Decision Impact
- **Grades A-C**: Uses quality-validated median target with confidence indicators
- **Grade D**: Still participates in trading but flagged for manual review
- **Grade F**: Excluded from buy/sell recommendations entirely
- **Fallback Protection**: Reverts to simple median if robust calculation fails

The robust mechanism **prioritizes data quality over raw numbers**, ensuring trading decisions are based on reliable analyst consensus rather than potentially misleading outliers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Trading Criteria
All trading criteria can be customized by editing a single file: `yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py`

This centralized configuration ensures consistency across:
- ACT column values (B/S/H/I)
- Color coding (green/red/yellow highlighting)
- Buy/Sell/Hold opportunity filtering
- All recommendation outputs

Example customization:
```python
# In yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py
class TradingCriteria:
    # Make BUY criteria more aggressive
    BUY_MIN_UPSIDE = 25.0              # Require 25% upside (was 20%)
    BUY_MIN_EXRET = 0.20               # Require 20% expected return (was 15%)
    
    # Make SELL criteria more conservative  
    SELL_MAX_UPSIDE = 3.0              # Sell if upside < 3% (was 5%)
    SELL_MIN_SHORT_INTEREST = 4.0      # Sell if SI > 4% (was 3%)
```

### üí∞ Intelligent Position Sizing

etorotrade features a sophisticated position sizing system that calculates optimal trade sizes based on portfolio allocation, risk management, and expected returns.

#### Position Sizing Strategy
- **Portfolio Value**: $450,000 (configurable in `yahoofinance/core/config.py`)
- **Base Position**: 0.5% of portfolio = $2,250 for standard opportunities  
- **High Conviction**: Up to 10% of portfolio = $45,000 for exceptional opportunities
- **Position Limits**: $1,000 minimum, $45,000 maximum (10% max allocation)
- **High Conviction Criteria**: EG >15% AND PP >0% AND EXRET >20%

#### Smart Sizing Logic
1. **Expected Return Adjustment**: Higher EXRET = larger positions
   - EXRET ‚â• 15%: High conviction multiplier (2-4x base position)
   - EXRET 10-15%: Moderate increase (1.5-2x base position)  
   - EXRET < 10%: Standard or reduced position

2. **Market Cap Scaling**: Position size scales with company size
   - Large cap (>$50B): Can support larger positions
   - Mid cap ($10-50B): Standard scaling
   - Small cap (<$10B): Reduced positions for higher risk

3. **Risk Management**: Automatic scaling for volatility and other risk factors

#### Display Format
Position sizes are shown in the SIZE column with intuitive formatting:
- $2,000 ‚Üí "2k"
- $7,500 ‚Üí "7.5k" 
- $15,000 ‚Üí "15k"

#### Exclusions
- ETFs and commodities: No position sizing (SIZE shows "--")
- Stocks under $500M market cap: Excluded for liquidity concerns
- Missing data: No position size without EXRET or market cap
