## üí≤ Three-Tier Trading System

etorotrade uses a sophisticated **three-tier trading system** that classifies stocks by market cap and applies appropriate risk-adjusted criteria. This approach recognizes that large-cap blue chips require different analysis than small-cap speculative plays.

### üèóÔ∏è Market Cap Tier Classification

**VALUE Tier (‚â•$100B)**: Large-cap quality companies
- **Philosophy**: Conservative approach for established blue chips
- **Examples**: Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon

**GROWTH Tier ($5B-$100B)**: Mid-cap growth companies  
- **Philosophy**: Balanced risk/reward for established growers
- **Examples**: Most established companies with growth potential

**BETS Tier (<$5B)**: Small-cap speculative positions
- **Philosophy**: Higher bar for speculative investments
- **Examples**: Small-cap growth stocks, emerging companies

**M Column**: Every output shows tier classification (V/G/B) for instant risk assessment

### üü¢ BUY Recommendations (Tier-Specific)

**VALUE Tier BUY** (‚â•$100B market cap):
- **Relaxed Upside**: 10%+ potential upside (vs 20% for others)
- **Analyst Consensus**: 65%+ buy ratings (vs 75% for others)  
- **Expected Return**: ‚â•7.5% (lower threshold for stability)
- **Risk Management**: Higher position size tolerance due to stability

**GROWTH Tier BUY** ($5B-$100B market cap):
- **Standard Upside**: 20%+ potential upside
- **Analyst Consensus**: 75%+ buy ratings
- **Expected Return**: ‚â•15% (standard requirement)
- **Risk Management**: Balanced position sizing and thresholds

**BETS Tier BUY** (<$5B market cap):
- **High Upside**: 30%+ potential upside (higher bar for risk)
- **Strong Consensus**: 80%+ buy ratings (more conviction needed)
- **High Return**: ‚â•25% expected return (compensation for risk)
- **Risk Management**: Smaller positions, stricter fundamentals

**Common BUY Requirements** (All Tiers):
- **Reasonable Volatility**: Beta between 0.25 and 3.0
- **Attractive Valuation**: Forward P/E 0.5-65.0, Trailing P/E required
- **Quality Factors**: PEG < 2.5, Low short interest (if available)
- **Sufficient Coverage**: ‚â•5 analyst ratings and ‚â•5 price targets

### üî¥ SELL Signals (Tier-Specific)

**VALUE Tier SELL** (‚â•$100B market cap):
- **Limited Upside**: <2.5% upside potential
- **Weak Support**: <55% buy ratings

**GROWTH Tier SELL** ($5B-$100B market cap):
- **Limited Upside**: <5% upside potential  
- **Weak Support**: <65% buy ratings

**BETS Tier SELL** (<$5B market cap):
- **Limited Upside**: <10% upside potential
- **Weak Support**: <75% buy ratings

**Common SELL Triggers** (All Tiers):
- **Overvaluation**: Forward P/E >65.0, PEG >3.0, or excessive PE expansion
- **Poor Fundamentals**: Earnings growth <-15%, Price performance <-35%
- **High Risk**: Short interest >3%, Beta >3.0, Expected return <2.5%

### ‚ö™ HOLD & üü° INCONCLUSIVE
- **HOLD**: Passes confidence thresholds but doesn't meet tier-specific BUY/SELL criteria
- **INCONCLUSIVE**: Insufficient analyst coverage (<5 targets or ratings)

## üìä Enhanced Data Columns

etorotrade now includes additional fundamental analysis columns for more comprehensive stock evaluation:

### New Data Columns
- **EG (Earnings Growth)**: Year-over-year earnings growth percentage from quarterly data
- **PP (Price Performance)**: 3-month price performance showing recent momentum (shows `--` when data unavailable)
- **Enhanced Position Sizing**: Updated to consider high conviction criteria

### Data Availability Notes
- **PP Column**: Shows `--` when price performance data is unavailable from Yahoo Finance API
- **Common for**: ETFs, crypto, international stocks, and smaller stocks
- **This is expected behavior** - the system correctly shows `--` instead of misleading information

### High Conviction Position Sizing
The system now identifies high conviction opportunities using multiple criteria:
- **High Conviction Criteria**: EG >15% AND PP >0% AND EXRET >20%
- **Position Range**: 0.5% to 10% of portfolio ($2,250 to $45,000)
- **Smart Scaling**: Higher conviction = larger position sizes

### üéØ Robust Target Price Mechanism

etorotrade features a sophisticated **quality-validated target price system** that goes beyond simple analyst medians to provide more reliable upside calculations:

#### Quality Assessment System
Every stock's analyst price targets are automatically graded on a **5-tier quality scale**:

- **Grade A (85-100)**: Excellent consensus with tight target ranges
- **Grade B (70-84)**: Good quality with minor disagreements
- **Grade C (55-69)**: Moderate quality with some outliers
- **Grade D (40-54)**: Poor quality requiring manual review
- **Grade F (<40)**: Excluded due to unreliable data

#### Robustness Scoring Factors
The system evaluates price target quality using multiple criteria:

- **Spread Analysis**: Penalizes excessive target ranges (>50% concerning, >75% severe)
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies extreme predictions that skew averages
- **Consensus Validation**: Rewards tight agreement between mean and median
- **Coverage Assessment**: Considers analyst count and expertise level
- **Price Reasonableness**: Flags targets >300% from current price

#### Trading Decision Impact
- **Grades A-C**: Uses quality-validated median target with confidence indicators
- **Grade D**: Still participates in trading but flagged for manual review
- **Grade F**: Excluded from buy/sell recommendations entirely
- **Fallback Protection**: Reverts to simple median if robust calculation fails

The robust mechanism **prioritizes data quality over raw numbers**, ensuring trading decisions are based on reliable analyst consensus rather than potentially misleading outliers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing Trading Criteria
All trading criteria can be customized by editing a single file: `yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py`

This centralized configuration ensures consistency across:
- ACT column values (B/S/H/I)
- M column tier classification (V/G/B)
- Color coding (green/red/yellow highlighting)
- Buy/Sell/Hold opportunity filtering
- All recommendation outputs

Example tier customization:
```python
# In yahoofinance/core/trade_criteria_config.py
class TradingCriteria:
    # Adjust market cap tier boundaries
    VALUE_TIER_MIN_CAP = 50_000_000_000   # $50B threshold (was $100B)
    GROWTH_TIER_MIN_CAP = 2_000_000_000   # $2B threshold (was $5B)
    
    # Customize VALUE tier BUY criteria (more conservative)
    VALUE_BUY_MIN_UPSIDE = 5.0            # Only 5% upside needed (was 10%)
    VALUE_BUY_MIN_BUY_PERCENTAGE = 60.0   # 60% consensus (was 65%)
    
    # Customize BETS tier BUY criteria (more aggressive)
    BETS_BUY_MIN_UPSIDE = 40.0            # Require 40% upside (was 30%)
    BETS_BUY_MIN_BUY_PERCENTAGE = 85.0    # 85% consensus (was 80%)
```

### üí∞ Intelligent Position Sizing

etorotrade features a sophisticated position sizing system that calculates optimal trade sizes based on portfolio allocation, risk management, and expected returns.

#### Position Sizing Strategy
- **Portfolio Value**: $450,000 (configurable in `yahoofinance/core/config.py`)
- **Base Position**: 0.5% of portfolio = $2,250 for standard opportunities  
- **High Conviction**: Up to 10% of portfolio = $45,000 for exceptional opportunities
- **Position Limits**: $1,000 minimum, $45,000 maximum (10% max allocation)
- **High Conviction Criteria**: EG >15% AND PP >0% AND EXRET >20%

#### Smart Sizing Logic
1. **Expected Return Adjustment**: Higher EXRET = larger positions
   - EXRET ‚â• 15%: High conviction multiplier (2-4x base position)
   - EXRET 10-15%: Moderate increase (1.5-2x base position)  
   - EXRET < 10%: Standard or reduced position

2. **Market Cap Scaling**: Position size scales with company size
   - Large cap (>$50B): Can support larger positions
   - Mid cap ($10-50B): Standard scaling
   - Small cap (<$10B): Reduced positions for higher risk

3. **Risk Management**: Automatic scaling for volatility and other risk factors

#### Display Format
Position sizes are shown in the SIZE column with intuitive formatting:
- $2,000 ‚Üí "2k"
- $7,500 ‚Üí "7.5k" 
- $15,000 ‚Üí "15k"

#### Exclusions
- ETFs and commodities: No position sizing (SIZE shows "--")
- Stocks under $500M market cap: Excluded for liquidity concerns
- Missing data: No position size without EXRET or market cap
