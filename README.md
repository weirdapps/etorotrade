## Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/weirdapps/etorotrade
cd etorotrade

# Create virtual environment (Python 3.8+ recommended)
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Unix
myenv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Market Analysis
```bash
python trade.py
```
Select data source:
- P: Portfolio file (yahoofinance/input/portfolio.csv)
- M: Market file (yahoofinance/input/market.csv)
- E: eToro Market file (yahoofinance/input/etoro.csv) - filtered for eToro-available tickers
- T: Trade analysis (buy/sell recommendations)
- I: Manual ticker(s) input (comma separated)

When selecting Trade Analysis (T), you can:
- B: Explore Buy opportunities (not in current portfolio)
- S: Explore Sell candidates in current portfolio
- H: Explore Hold candidates (stocks that meet neither buy nor sell criteria)

The analysis automatically saves results to CSV files:
- Buy recommendations: yahoofinance/output/buy.csv
- Sell recommendations: yahoofinance/output/sell.csv
- Hold recommendations: yahoofinance/output/hold.csv
- Market analysis: yahoofinance/output/market.csv
- Portfolio analysis: yahoofinance/output/portfolio.csv

### Ticker Management

#### Yahoo Finance Validation
The system has built-in ticker validation to filter out invalid or delisted tickers. This prevents errors during batch processing and improves overall reliability.

To validate tickers:
```bash
# Run this to validate tickers against Yahoo Finance API
python -m yahoofinance.validate
```

The validation process:
1. Asks for tickers to be validated 
2. Checks each ticker against Yahoo Finance API
3. Saves valid tickers to `yahoofinance/input/yfinance.csv`

This significantly improves processing time and reduces API errors when running market analysis.

#### "No Trade" List
The system supports a list of tickers to exclude from trading recommendations (yahoofinance/input/notrade.csv). Tickers in this list will still be analyzed but won't appear in buy/sell recommendations.

Format of notrade.csv:
```
symbol
AAPL
MSFT
...
```

#### eToro Ticker Management
The yahoofinance/input/etoro.csv file contains a subset of tickers that are available for trading on eToro. By using the 'E' option in the main program, you can analyze only these eToro-tradable stocks, significantly reducing processing time from potentially thousands of tickers to just the ones you can actually trade.

Format of etoro.csv:
```
symbol,name
AAPL,Apple Inc.
MSFT,Microsoft Corporation
AMZN,Amazon.com Inc.
...
```

You can manually edit this file to add or remove tickers as you discover what's available on eToro. This focused approach makes analysis much faster and more relevant for your trading activities.

## Metrics Guide

### Price Metrics
- **PRICE**: Current stock price
- **TARGET**: Average analyst target
- **UPSIDE**: Target vs current price (%)
- **EXRET**: Expected return (Upside Ã— Buy%)

### Analyst Coverage
- **# T**: Number of price targets
- **% BUY**: Buy rating percentage
- **# A**: Number of ratings
- **A**: Rating source (E: post-earnings, A: all-time)

### Valuation
- **PET**: Trailing P/E ratio
- **PEF**: Forward P/E ratio
- **PEG**: Price/Earnings to Growth
- **DIV%**: Dividend yield

### Risk Metrics
- **BETA**: Market volatility comparison
- **SI**: Short interest percentage
- **INS%**: Insider buy percentage
- **# INS**: Insider transaction count

## Trading Recommendation Criteria

The system classifies stocks into four categories:

- ðŸŸ¡ **INCONCLUSIVE** (Low Confidence/Insufficient Data)
  * Less than 5 price targets OR
  * Less than 5 analyst ratings

For stocks that pass the confidence threshold (5+ price targets and 5+ analyst ratings):

- ðŸ”´ **SELL** - Checked first due to risk management priority, triggered if ANY of these conditions are met:
  * Less than 5% upside OR
  * Less than 65% buy ratings OR
  * PEF > PET (deteriorating earnings outlook, when both are positive) OR
  * PEF > 45.0 (extremely high valuation) OR
  * PEG > 3.0 (overvalued relative to growth) OR
  * SI > 4% (high short interest) OR
  * Beta > 3.0 (excessive volatility) OR
  * EXRET < 10.0 (insufficient expected return)

- ðŸŸ¢ **BUY** - Checked after eliminating sell candidates, ALL of these conditions must be met:
  * 20% or more upside AND
  * 82% or more buy ratings AND
  * Beta <= 3.0 (acceptable volatility) AND
  * Beta > 0.2 (sufficient volatility) AND
  * PEF < PET (improving earnings outlook) OR Trailing P/E â‰¤ 0 (negative) AND
  * PEF > 0.5 (positive earnings projection) AND
  * PEF <= 45.0 (reasonable valuation) AND
  * PEG < 3.0 (reasonable valuation relative to growth) - *ignored if PEG data not available* AND
  * SI <= 3% (acceptable short interest) - *ignored if SI data not available*

- âšª **HOLD** - Stocks with balanced risk profile
  * Stocks that pass the confidence check
  * Don't meet the criteria for Buy or Sell recommendations

**Note:** These exact same criteria are used for both coloring in market/portfolio views and for filtering stocks into the buy/sell/hold lists. There is perfect alignment between the color a stock receives in the main views and which list it appears in with the trade command.

## Architecture

The system uses a modular architecture:
1. **Client Layer** (client.py): API interactions with rate limiting
2. **Utilities Layer**: Reusable components for different operations
   - **Specialized Submodules**:
     - `utils/data/` - Data formatting and transformation utilities
     - `utils/network/` - Rate limiting and API communication
     - `utils/market/` - Market-specific utilities like ticker validation
     - `utils/date/` - Date manipulation and formatting
     - `utils/async/` - Asynchronous operation helpers
3. **Analysis Layer** (Multiple modules): Data processing and calculations
4. **Display Layer** (display.py): Output formatting and presentation

Key components:
- **YFinanceError Hierarchy**: Comprehensive error handling system
- **AdaptiveRateLimiter**: Advanced rate limiting with thread safety
- **YFinanceClient**: Handles Yahoo Finance API interactions
- **Cache**: LRU caching system with size limiting
- **StockData**: Core data structure for stock information
- **DisplayFormatter**: Formats data for console output
- **MarketDisplay**: Manages batch processing and report generation
- **PaginatedResults**: Handles paginated API responses efficiently

## Trading Platform Integration

### eToro Compatibility
- **Hong Kong Stocks**: Automatic normalization of HK stock tickers
  * Removes leading zeros from 5+ digit ticker numbers
  * Example: eToro's `03690.HK` format is automatically converted to `3690.HK`
  * Compatible with portfolio.csv imports from eToro
- **Crypto Tickers**: Standardizes eToro's crypto tickers
  * Automatically converts tickers to the `-USD` format (e.g., `BTC-USD`, `ETH-USD`)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Market-Specific Data Fetching**
  * Automatically detects US vs non-US tickers based on exchange suffix
  * Skips known-to-fail API calls for non-US exchanges (ratings, insider data, short interest)
  * Reduces API load and speeds up batch processing by 20-30% for international stocks
  * Falls back to available data sources for non-US market analysis
- **Extended Ticker Format Support**
  * Standard tickers: validated up to 10 characters
  * Exchange-specific tickers: validated up to 20 characters
  * Supports complex formats like `MAERSK-A.CO` (Danish market)

## Display Formatting

The system follows consistent formatting rules:

- **Company Names**: 
  * Always displayed in ALL CAPS for readability
  * Truncated to maximum 14 characters if needed
  * Left-aligned in all table outputs

- **Market Cap Formatting**:
  * Trillion-scale values use "T" suffix (e.g., "2.75T")
    * â‰¥ 10T: 1 decimal place (e.g., "12.5T")
    * < 10T: 2 decimal places (e.g., "2.75T")
  * Billion-scale values use "B" suffix (e.g., "175B")
    * â‰¥ 100B: No decimals (e.g., "175B")
    * â‰¥ 10B and < 100B: 1 decimal place (e.g., "25.5B")
    * < 10B: 2 decimal places (e.g., "5.25B")
  * Right-aligned in all table outputs
  
- **Percentage Formatting**:
  * Upside, EXRET, SI use 1 decimal place with % suffix (e.g., "27.9%")
  * Buy percentage uses 0 decimal places with % suffix (e.g., "85%")
  * Dividend yield uses 2 decimal places with % suffix (e.g., "0.84%")

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Rate Limiting Errors**
   * Symptom: "API rate limit exceeded" errors
   * Solution: The system implements automatic backoff. Simply wait and retry.

2. **Invalid Ticker Errors**
   * Symptom: "Invalid ticker" warnings during batch processing
   * Solution: Run `python -m yahoofinance.validate` to update the valid tickers list

3. **Missing Data for Non-US Stocks**
   * Symptom: Missing analyst ratings or insider data for international tickers
   * Reason: These data points are often unavailable through the API for non-US markets
   * Solution: The system automatically adapts by skipping unavailable data sources

4. **Format Errors in Input Files**
   * Symptom: "KeyError" or "Expected column X" errors
   * Solution: Check the format of your input CSV files against the examples provided
