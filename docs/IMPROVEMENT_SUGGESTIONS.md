## Executive Summary

Framework analysis complete. Identified 5 improvement opportunities
(2 HIGH priority). Key finding: PEG ratio has no predictive value and should
be removed. EXR remains the strongest signal driver. Data quality is the primary bottleneck
with 56.8% INCONCLUSIVE signals due to limited analyst coverage.

## Key Insights

1. Framework is HIGHLY selective: Only 18/5531 (0.33%) stocks receive BUY signal
2. EXR (Expected Return) is the BEST predictor with 4.27x differentiation
3. PEG ratio has NO predictive power (ratio: 0.94x) - recommend removal
4. Data availability is the PRIMARY bottleneck: 56.8% INCONCLUSIVE
5. MICRO caps are 80% INCONCLUSIVE - consider excluding from active universe
6. HK has BEST data coverage (89.5% conclusive) vs EU (35.0%)

## Improvement Suggestions

### 1. [HIGH]  Remove PEG from BUY Criteria

**Category:** metric

**Description:** PEG ratio has zero predictive power between BUY and SELL signals

**Evidence:** BUY median: 1.60, SELL median: 1.70, Ratio: 1.06x

**Action:** Set max_peg to 6.0 or higher to effectively disable, or remove from criteria entirely

**Expected Impact:** Removes noise from signal generation without affecting quality

### 2. [HIGH]  Address High INCONCLUSIVE Rate

**Category:** data

**Description:** 56.8% of stocks are INCONCLUSIVE due to data gaps

**Evidence:** Primary causes: Low analyst count (<4) (63.8%), Missing buy percentage (41.7%), Missing target price (25.5%)

**Action:** Integrate additional data sources (Refinitiv, Bloomberg) or relax thresholds for smaller caps

**Expected Impact:** Increase actionable signal coverage by 20-30%

### 3. [MEDIUM]  Relax SMALL Cap Analyst Requirements

**Category:** threshold

**Description:** SMALL cap stocks have 42% INCONCLUSIVE rate due to limited analyst coverage

**Evidence:** SMALL tier: 567 of 1339 INCONCLUSIVE

**Action:** Reduce min_analyst_count from 4 to 3 for SMALL tier

**Expected Impact:** Increase SMALL cap coverage by ~20%

### 4. [LOW]  Re-evaluate 52-Week Position Metric

**Category:** metric

**Description:** 52-week position provides minimal differentiation between signals

**Evidence:** BUY median: 91.5%, SELL median: 88.0%, Ratio: 1.04x

**Action:** Consider using only for SELL triggers or removing

**Expected Impact:** Slight simplification of signal logic

### 5. [LOW]  Maintain High-Value Metrics

**Category:** metric

**Description:** Several metrics show excellent predictive power and should be preserved

**Evidence:** Top performers: SI (4.27x), EXR (3.50x), UP% (1.78x)

**Action:** Keep EXR, SI, and ROE thresholds as primary signal drivers

**Expected Impact:** Maintains signal quality
