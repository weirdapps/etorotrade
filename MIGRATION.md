# Migration to Unified Codebase

This document describes the migration from the previous multi-version codebase to a unified structure.

## Changes Made

1. **Consolidated trade.py**:
   - The functionality from trade2.py has been moved to trade.py
   - The original trade.py has been backed up in backups/trade.py.orig

2. **Reorganized yahoofinance**:
   - The yahoofinance package now contains the improved implementation previously in yahoofinance_v2
   - The original yahoofinance has been moved to yahoofinance.old

3. **Deprecated Files**:
   - trade2.py is now deprecated but maintained temporarily for backward compatibility
   - yahoofinance_v1 directory is deprecated but retained for reference
   - yahoofinance_v2 directory is deprecated but retained for reference
   - yahoofinance.old directory is deprecated but retained for reference

4. **Import Path Updates**:
   - All imports from yahoofinance_v2 have been updated to use yahoofinance

## Testing the Migration

To ensure the migration was successful, you can:

1. Run the main application: `python trade.py`
2. Test specific modules: `python -m yahoofinance.news`

All functionality should be identical to the previous version but with simplified imports.

## Cleanup Plan

Once the migration is confirmed to be working correctly, the following files can be safely removed:

1. trade2.py
2. yahoofinance.old/
3. yahoofinance_v1/
4. yahoofinance_v2/

This cleanup should be done as a separate step after thorough testing.
