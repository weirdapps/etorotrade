        # Risk Assessment: MEDIUM
        # - This is an official Anthropic action but in beta phase
        # - Mitigation strategies implemented:
        #   1. Required environment approval (claude-prod)
        #   2. Minimal permissions granted
        #   3. Trigger validation step
        #   4. Secrets stored securely in GitHub
        #
        # TODO: Pin to specific SHA once stable release is available
        # Track at: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/releases
        #
        # Alternative: Consider disabling this workflow until stable version available
