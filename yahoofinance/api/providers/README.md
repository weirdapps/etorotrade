# API Providers

This directory is reserved for future implementation of alternative data providers beyond Yahoo Finance.

## Planned Structure

```
providers/
├── base.py           # Base provider interface
├── yahoo_provider.py # Yahoo Finance implementation
├── alpha_provider.py # Alpha Vantage implementation (future)
└── custom_provider.py # Custom data source (future)
```

The provider architecture will allow for:
- Pluggable data sources
- Consistent interface across providers
- Fallback mechanisms when primary source is unavailable
- Provider-specific rate limiting and caching

This directory is currently a placeholder for future development.
