# BREAKING CHANGE: Remove Compatibility Layer (v2.0.0)

## Summary
This PR removes the compatibility (compat) layer, which has been deprecated for some time. All functionality has been migrated to canonical modules, and the codebase has been verified to work correctly without the compat folder.

## Changes
- Remove the deprecated `yahoofinance/compat/` directory completely
- Bump version to 2.0.0 to indicate breaking change
- Remove compatibility tests that depend on the compat folder
- Update documentation to reflect the removal

## Migration Guide for Users
All functionality previously available in the compat layer is now available through canonical imports:

### Analyst Data
```python
# Old import (removed)
from yahoofinance.compat.analyst import AnalystData

# New import
from yahoofinance.analysis.analyst import CompatAnalystData
```

### Client Interface
```python
# Old approach (removed)
from yahoofinance.compat.client import YFinanceClient
client = YFinanceClient()
data = client.get_ticker_info("AAPL")

# New approach
from yahoofinance.api import get_provider
provider = get_provider()
data = provider.get_ticker_info("AAPL")
```

### Earnings Calendar
```python
# Old import (removed)
from yahoofinance.compat.earnings import EarningsCalendar

# New import
from yahoofinance.analysis.earnings import EarningsCalendar
```

### Display Formatting
```python
# Old import (removed)
from yahoofinance.compat.formatting import DisplayFormatter

# New import
from yahoofinance.presentation.formatter import DisplayFormatter
```

### Market Display
```python
# Old import (removed)
from yahoofinance.compat.display import MarketDisplay

# New import
from yahoofinance.presentation.console import MarketDisplay
```

### Pricing Analysis
```python
# Old import (removed)
from yahoofinance.compat.pricing import PricingAnalyzer

# New import
from yahoofinance.analysis.market import MarketAnalyzer
```

## Test Plan
- [x] Successfully run all tests with the compat folder temporarily renamed
- [x] Created and tested TestProviderMigration that doesn't use compat imports
- [x] Verified the main application works without the compat folder
- [x] Checked that no internal modules depend on the compat folder

## Impact and Benefits
- **Simplified Codebase**: Removes duplicate code and simplifies import paths
- **Reduced Maintenance**: One source of truth for each component
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Enforces the provider pattern as the canonical data access method
- **Better Performance**: Direct imports reduce overhead
- **Improved Test Coverage**: Tests now use canonical sources directly

## Version
This is a breaking change. The version has been bumped from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0 to indicate a major version change.
