# Migration Status

This document tracks the status of migrating from the old v1 API to the new v2 API with provider pattern.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implemented provider pattern with both synchronous and asynchronous variants
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite for provider-based implementations
- [x] Enhanced rate limiting with adaptive delays and batch processing
- [x] Added resilient circuit breaker pattern for API requests
- [x] Implemented caching with size limits and TTL configuration
- [x] Eliminated duplicate code in utility modules
- [x] Restructured compatibility layer to import from canonical sources
- [x] Updated tests to use canonical sources directly when possible
- [x] Created test fixtures for consistent test data
- [x] Documented code with comprehensive docstrings
- [x] Created configuration for trading criteria and network settings

## Phase Out of Compatibility Layer

The `compat` folder is now ready for removal through the following steps:

1. **Phase 1: Consolidation (Completed)**
   - Compatibility classes now import from canonical sources
   - Duplicate code has been eliminated
   - Core modules no longer have direct dependencies on compat modules

2. **Phase 2: Migration Path (Completed)**
   - Test files have been updated to import directly from canonical modules
   - End-to-end tests have been updated to use the provider pattern
   - Main application code already uses the provider pattern or canonical modules

3. **Phase 3: Deprecation (Completed)**
   - Added deprecation warnings to all imports from the compat folder
   - Updated all remaining tests to use canonical sources
   - Documented recommended replacement imports in docstrings

4. **Phase 4: Removal (Ready)**
   - All tests pass with the compat folder temporarily renamed
   - The codebase has been verified to work correctly without the compat folder
   - The TestProviderMigration class has been created to replace TestProviderCompatibility
   - Final removal will be done with a major version bump to indicate breaking change
   - NEXT STEP: Remove compat folder and create v2.0.0 release

## Usage Instructions for Canonical Sources

### Analyst Data

**Old import (deprecated):**
```python
from yahoofinance.compat.analyst import AnalystData
```

**New import:**
```python
from yahoofinance.analysis.analyst import CompatAnalystData
```

### Earnings Calendar

**Old import (deprecated):**
```python
from yahoofinance.compat.earnings import EarningsCalendar, format_earnings_table
```

**New import:**
```python
from yahoofinance.analysis.earnings import EarningsCalendar, format_earnings_table
```

### Client

**Old import (deprecated):**
```python
from yahoofinance.compat.client import YFinanceClient
```

**New import (using provider pattern):**
```python
from yahoofinance.api import get_provider
provider = get_provider()  # Use provider.get_ticker_info() etc.
```

### Display Formatting

**Old import (deprecated):**
```python
from yahoofinance.compat.formatting import DisplayFormatter, DisplayConfig
```

**New import:**
```python
from yahoofinance.presentation.formatter import DisplayFormatter, DisplayConfig
```

### Market Display

**Old import (deprecated):**
```python
from yahoofinance.compat.display import MarketDisplay
```

**New import:**
```python
from yahoofinance.presentation.console import MarketDisplay
```

### Pricing Analysis

**Old import (deprecated):**
```python
from yahoofinance.compat.pricing import PricingAnalyzer
```

**New import:**
```python
from yahoofinance.analysis.market import MarketAnalyzer
```

## Additional Notes

- Tests that still use the compatibility layer will continue to work, but should be migrated
- The migration should be seamless for most use cases as the interfaces remain compatible
- The provider pattern offers more flexibility and better performance than the old client interface
